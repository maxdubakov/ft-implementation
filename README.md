# Signal Processing and Fourier Transform

This repository contains implementations for various signal processing techniques, including:

- Fourier Transform (FT) for audio
- Fourier Transform for images

## Note

This project is intended for learning purposes. The implementations may not be efficient and are meant to help understand the concepts of signal processing and Fourier transforms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run the notebook you like to see examples.
