# Signal Processing and Fourier Transform

This repository contains implementations for various signal processing techniques, including:

- Fourier Transform (FT) for signals
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for signals
- FFT for image processing

## Note

This project is intended for learning purposes. The implementations may not be efficient and are meant to help understand the concepts of signal processing and Fourier transforms.

## Requirements

- numpy
- sounddevice
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the `ft.py` script to generate and analyze audio signals.

## Future Work

- Implement FFT for signals and images.
- Enhance visualization of frequency components.
